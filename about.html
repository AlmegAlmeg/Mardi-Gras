            <h1>Our History - Larger Than Life!</h1>
            <img src="img/logo.png" alt="logo">
            <p>The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing through Rome and Venice in the 17th
                and 18th centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf
                Gras," or fatted calf, followed France to her colonies.</p>
            <p>On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at a plot of
                ground 60 miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his men realized
                it was the eve of the festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la Louisiane" (which is
                now Mobile) in 1702. In 1703, the tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated America's very
                first Mardi Gras.</p>
            <p>New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in New
                Orleans, but not with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the Marquis
                de Vaudreuil, established elegant society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras
                balls of today.</p>
            <p>The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish colonial
                governing body. That year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of
                hundreds of clubs and carnival organizations formed in New Orleans.</p>
            <p>By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and horseback riders to
                celebrate Mardi Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members and
                lent each event an exciting air of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed the
                Mistick Krewe of Comus, invoking John Milton's hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus brought
                magic and mystery to New Orleans with dazzling floats (known as tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe
                members remained anonymous.</p>
            <img src="img/sliderimg4.jpg" alt="costumes" class="with-border">
            <p>In 1870, Mardi Gras' second Krewe, the Twelfth Night Revelers, was formed. This is also the first
                recorded account of Mardi Gras "throws."</p>
            <p>Newspapers began to announce Mardi Gras events in advance, and they even printed "Carnival Edition"
                lithographs of parades' fantastic float designs (after they rolled, of course - themes and floats were
                always carefully guarded before the procession). At first, these reproductions were small, and details
                could not be clearly seen. But beginning in 1886 with Proteus' parade "Visions of Other Worlds," these
                chromolithographs could be produced in full, saturated color, doing justice to the float and costume
                designs of Carlotta Bonnecase, Charles Briton and B.A. Wikstrom. Each of these designers' work was
                brought to life by talented Parisian paper-mache' artist Georges Soulie', who for 40 years was
                responsible for creating all of Carnival's floats and processional outfits.</p>

            <h1>Female Krewes - No More Bro Show</h1>
            <img src="img/sliderimg5.jpg" alt="" class="with-border">
            <p>For most of its illustrious history, Mardi Gras in New Orleans was a bro show. While women participated
                behind the scenes, all-male krewes meant just that – no women allowed. Then, when Carnival celebrations
                merged with the debutante season in the city, women began to play a more prominent role as queens and
                Mardi Gras courts.</p>
            <p>Still, it wasn’t enough just to be arm candy. It wasn’t long before women wanted their own organizations
                and, in 1922, the Krewe of Iris was formed. While Iris became the first organization to have their
                tableaux ball televised, they didn’t parade until 1959.</p>
            <h3>The First All-Female Parade</h3>
            <p>In 1941, The Krewe of Venus became the first all-female parade but it wasn’t all glitter and sequins.
                First of all, it rained. Second, some men along the parade route threw rotten vegetables at the riders.
                Despite all that, the women had a great time and when Mardi Gras resumed again after World War II, Venus
                was there.</p>
            <p>From the 1960s on, Venus and Iris were joined by several all-women krewes, including Helios and Diana in
                Metairie, Isis in Kenner, Pandora in Gentilly, Cleopatra (West Bank) and Eve in Mandeville.</p>
            <img src="img/sliderimg1.jpg" alt="female krewes" class="with-border">
            <h3>Female Superkrewes</h3>
            <p>In 2000, women not affiliated with the existing female krewes formed the Krewe of Muses with an
                open-membership policy. Their numbers and popularity swelled almost overnight. Today, they are 1,500
                members strong and are known for their signature throw – the hand-decorated Muses shoe – one of those
                valuable treasures of Mardi Gras. They were also the first female krewe to parade Uptown at night.</p>
            <p>The Krewe of Muses was so popular that a spin-off krewe, The Mystic Krewe of Nyx, was formed to take the
                pressure off Muses' waiting list. Today, the Krewe of Nyx has more than 1,200 numbers and a waiting list
                of its own. They throw purses – another coveted throw.</p>

            <h1>Our Major - LaToya Cantrell</h1>
            <img src="img/major.jpg" alt="major" class="with-border">
            <p>LaToya Cantrell (born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans,
                Louisiana, a post she has held since May 7, 2018. </p>
            <h3>Mayor of New Orleans</h3>
            <p>Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the city's
                history. Once in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating a
                strategic plan to address families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction
                Council, tasked with finding solutions to violent crime. Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes
                collected within the city for city use, Cantrell has focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve
                city infrastructure, public transportation, public parks, and green spaces. As part of that initiative,
                in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against four opioid manufacturers and
                distributors.</p>
            <p>During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share Agreement with
                Governor John Bel Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The agreement secured $50 million in
                upfront funding for the city's infrastructure needs as well as $26 million in annual recurring revenue
                for the city. Following the approval of the Fair Share Agreement, New Orleans voters approved 3 of the 4
                proposals Mayor Cantrell and the City Council put on the ballot in the 2019 general election. Voters
                approved a $500 million bond sale and a tax on short-term rental properties, as well the establishment
                of a Human Right Commission under the New Orleans Home Rule Charter.</p>

        <section class="about-section indians">
            <h1>Indians - Discover History</h1>
            <img src="img/indian.jpg" alt="indian man" class="with-border">
            <p>"Mardi Gras Indians are secretive because only certain people participated in masking--people with
                questionable character. In the old day, the Indians were violent. Indians would meet on Mardi Gras; it
                was a day to settle scores." - <span>Larry Bannock, Past President, New Orleans Mardi Gras Indian
                    Council</span> </p>
            <p>Mardi Gras is full of secrets, and the Mardi Gras Indians are as much a part of that secrecy as any other
                carnival organization. Their parade dates, times and routes are never published in advance, although
                they do tend to gather in the same areas every year.</p>
            <p>The Mardi Gras Indians are comprised, in large part, of the African-American communities of New Orleans's
                inner city. While these Indians have paraded for well over a century, their parade is perhaps the least
                recognized Mardi Gras tradition.</p>
            <p>"Mardi Gras Indians--the parade most white people don't see. The ceremonial procession is loose, the
                parade is not scheduled for a particular time or route...that is up to the Big Chief." - <span>Larry
                    Bannock</span>
            </p>
            <p>Traditional Mardi Gras organizations form a "krewe." A krewe often names their parade after a particular
                Roman or Greek mythological hero or god. The ranking structure of a Mardi Gras Krewe is a parody of
                royalty: King, Queen, Dukes, Knights and Captains, or some variation of that theme. Many of the more
                established krewes allow membership by invitation only.</p>
            <p>Few in the ghetto felt they could ever participate in the typical New Orleans parade. Historically,
                slavery and racism were at the root of this cultural separation. The black neighborhoods in New Orleans
                gradually developed their own style of celebrating Mardi Gras. Their krewes are named for imaginary
                Indian tribes according to the streets of their ward or gang.</p>
            <p>The Mardi Gras Indians named themselves after native Indians to pay them respect for their assistance in
                escaping the tyranny of slavery. It was often local Indians who accepted slaves into their society when
                they made a break for freedom. They have never forgotten this support.</p>
            <img src="img/indian2.jpg" alt="indian man" class="with-border">
            <p>Long ago, Mardi Gras was a violent day for many Mardi Gras Indians. It was a day often used to settle
                scores. The police were often unable to intervene due to the general confusion surrounding Mardi Gras
                events in the city, when the streets were crowded and everyone was masked. This kept many families away
                from the "parade," and created much worry and concern for a mothers whose children wanted to join the
                Indians.</p>
            <p>"'I'm gonna mask that morning if it costs me my life!' That morning you pray and ask God to watch over
                you, cause everybody is bucking for number one." - <span>Larry Bannock</span> </p>
            <p>Today when two Mardi Gras Indian tribes pass one another, you will see a living theater of art and
                culture. Each tribe's style and dress is on display in a friendly but competitive manner. They compare
                one another's art and craftsmanship.</p>
            <p>Although there was a history of violence, many now choose to keep this celebration friendly. Each Big
                Chief will eventually stand back and, with a theatrical display of self-confidence, acknowledge the
                artistry and craftsmanship of the other chief's suit.</p>

            <img src="img/traditions.jpg" alt="traditions" class="with-border">
            <p>Mardi Gras is about music, parades, picnics, floats and excitement. It's one big holiday in New Orleans!
            </p>
            <p>Revelers know to wear costumes or at least dress in purple, green, and gold, and adorn themselves with
                long beads caught from the floats of previous parades. You'll see a lot of crazy costumes, kids with
                their families are everywhere, and both locals and visitors having a great time. Parade goers will sit
                on the ground, throw balls, play music, eat great food and watch the crowds walk by between parades. On
                Mardi Gras day, the majority of non-essential businesses are shut down because of the celebration.</p>
            <p>Experienced revelers know to bring a large bag with them so they can haul away all the beads and trinkets
                they will catch from the parades!</p>
            <p>Every year, we get a lot of questions about how it all begin, and how the traditions have changed. Click
                on the buttons below to find out the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions.</p>
            <h3>“Super Krewe” Balls</h3>
            <p>Some large parades produce an indoor extravaganza the night of their parade. While all balls are exciting
                events, Bacchus, Orpheus, and Endymion, the three “super krewes,” put on the best balls by far!</p>
            <p>In Greek mythology, Bacchus is the god of wine and vegetation—and they host a celebration fitting of its
                namesake god. Mardi Gras balls were exclusive events closed off from most people outside of New Orleans
                society until this krewe revolutionized the event. In 1949, Edward Brennan Sr. created the krewe, a
                carnival Ball open to tourists. As they say, the first is the best because this event has become the
                talk of the town for tourists and locals alike!</p>
